# Computational-Mathematics
A selection of programs that employ basic techniques of computational mathematics that include; matrix computations, data fitting techniques (interpolation and least squares), image and signal processing, optimization, quadrature, initial value problems, computational efficiency, and visualization. The primary motive for the design of these programs were to enhance skills in critical thinking and problem solving using the Matlab software package.
